# NNBBS 128

No Name BBS for the Commodore 128


Originally written in 1991, and salvaged a couple of years ago around 2019 from 1571 disks.
Now, transferred to 1571 disk images, and added to a new git repo.
Hopefully we can work on this program and get it working with support for modern
add ons such as the Ultimate products, and other things.
